"""Tests for the candidate-pool ranking/filtering in :mod:`humeo.clip_selector`.

Covers the "over-generate -> threshold with a floor" policy:

- scores are the primary rank signal
- clips above ``threshold`` are always kept
- if fewer than ``min_kept`` clear the threshold, backfill from the next
  best candidates so the pipeline never ships zero shorts
- the final list is capped at ``max_kept``
- ``needs_review`` clips are demoted but still eligible as a backfill
- ``clip_id`` is renumbered densely in rank order
- empty input is handled without raising
